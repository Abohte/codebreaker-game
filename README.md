# Codebreaker game

Simple Ruby game made following week 2 of the 9-week Codaisseur Academy.

Assignment: write a codebreaker algorithm in Ruby, following TDD. The game is Mastermind with numbers instead of colours. Setup, including test suite, was provided.

## Steps

Based on the provided test suite, I fulfilled the requirements of each context in order:

- [A] basic set up  
- [B] with no matches  
- [C] with 1 match  
- [D] with 2 matches  
- [E] with 3 matches  
- [F] with 4 matches  
- [G] with ambiguous matches
